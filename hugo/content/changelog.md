  * <span style="color:red">Upgrading to this version will break few existing steps, please read the following notes for more information.</span>.
  * Multiple Fixes: [#29](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jira-steps-plugin/issues/29) Make `id` type consistent across and other minor fixes.
    * Made `id` type consistent (to `String`) across all the objects. (Non Passive change, existing code need to be changed to use Strings, this is applicable for mostly all the steps).
    * Changes to `jiraNewIssue` and `jiraNewIssues`.
      * Allow issue type look up by name (`fields->issuetype->name`).
      * Allow project look up by key (`fields->project->key`).
    * `@ToString` is duplicate in all api objects (`@Data` should take care of it already.)
    * `Array` type can be just either `List` or `Set`. Changed across all objects. No need of as String[] anymore. Ex: `['a','b'] as String[]` is now just `['a', 'b']`. (Non Passive change).
    * `fields` variable is in the wrong position for `Transitions`.
    * Updated documentation accordingly.
  * [#28](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jira-steps-plugin/issues/28) ISSUE-28 Enable more fields while creating/updating issues.
  * Added Terms and Conditions - Google Analytics.
