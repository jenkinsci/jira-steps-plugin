## Overview

Creates new issue based on given input, which should have some minimal information on that object.

![New Issue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThoughtsLive/jira-steps/master/docs/images/jira_new_issue.png)

## Input

* **issue** - issue to be created.
* **site** - Optional, default: `JIRA_SITE` environment variable.
* **failOnError** - Optional. default: `true`.
* **auditLog** - Optional. default: `true`. Append a panel to the comment with the build url and build user name.

**Note**: It supports all the fields that any jira instance supports including custom fields. For more information about all available input fields, please refer to the [JIRA Api documentation](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/) depending on your JIRA version.

## Output

* Each step generates generic output, please refer to this [link](config.html#common-response--error-handling) for more information.
* The api response of this jira_new_issue step can be reused later in your script by doing `response.data.required_field_name`.
* You can see some example scenarios [here](https://jenkinsci.github.io/jira-steps-plugin/common_usages.html)
* All the available fields for a jira component can be found in [JIRA Api documentation](https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/) depending on your JIRA version.

Note: response.data returns all the fields returned by JIRA API.

## Example usages of generated script

* With default [site](config#environment-variables) from global variables.

  ```groovy
  node {
    stage('JIRA') {
      # Look at IssueInput class for more information.
      def testIssue = [fields: [ // id or key must present for project.
                                 project: [id: '10000'],
                                 summary: 'New JIRA Created from Jenkins.',
                                 description: 'New JIRA Created from Jenkins.',
                                 customfield_1000: 'customValue',
                                 // id or name must present for issueType.
                                 issuetype: [id: '3']]]

      response = jiraNewIssue issue: testIssue

      echo response.successful.toString()
      echo response.data.toString()
    }
  }
  ```
* `withEnv` to override the default site (or if there is not global site)

  ```groovy
  node {
    stage('JIRA') {
      withEnv(['JIRA_SITE=LOCAL']) {
        def testIssue = [fields: [ project: [id: '10000'],
                                   summary: 'New JIRA Created from Jenkins.',
                                   description: 'New JIRA Created from Jenkins.',
                                   issuetype: [id: '3']]]

        response = jiraNewIssue issue: testIssue

        echo response.successful.toString()
        echo response.data.toString()
      }
    }
  }
  ```
* Without environment variables.

  ```groovy
  def testIssue = [fields: [ project: [id: '10000'],
                             summary: 'New JIRA Created from Jenkins.',
                             description: 'New JIRA Created from Jenkins.',
                             issuetype: [id: '3']]]

  response = jiraNewIssue issue: testIssue, site: 'LOCAL'

  echo response.successful.toString()
  echo response.data.toString()
  ```
